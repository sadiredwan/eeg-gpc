Resting EEG and MEG data was gathered for two independently collected samples of healthy and First Episode Psychosis (FEP) individuals.
To obtain resting data, EEG channels were recorded for 5 minutes using an Elekta Neuromag Vectorview system.
EEG was recorded using a low-impedance 10-10 system 60-channel cap. 
The first collected sample of EEG data is provided here. This sample includes a portion of subjects from the second acquisition (EEG: First Episode Psychosis vs. Control Resting Task 2), since they were collected using the same montage.
The subjects from Task 2 that have been included here are: sub-2140A, sub-2170A, sub-2174A, sub-2176A, sub-2177A, sub-2184A, sub-2193A, sub-2214A, sub-2217A, sub-2221A.
